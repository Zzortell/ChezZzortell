            What did I do in my life?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I discovered my passion at the age of 14: designing and building web sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my high school years, I had my first professional experience and I learned to use <strong>Symfony</strong>, a framework I fell in love with.
        </p>
        <p>
            After getting my Baccalaureate degree, I studied for two years Mathematics and Physics at Lycée Pasteur in Neuilly-sur-Seine.
            I took advantage of my holidays to do an internship at KNPLabs, renowned for their active contribution to the Symfony ecosystem. For my second year project, I realized an artificial intelligence learning to play Mario Bros by itself.
        </p>

            What do I do now?

        <p>
            Today, I am <strong>19 years old</strong> and I am an <strong>independent full-stack developer</strong>.
            I develop websites and applications with Symfony.
