                name:   Baccalaureate's TPE: <br/>An autonomous underwater city
                description: |
                    Made for my TPE ("Framed Practical Work", a Baccalaureate's exam) in March 2014,
                    it was my first project in Javascript.
                    It aimed at illustrating our TPE, the problematic of which was
                    "How to build an underwater city fully autonomous."
                    The application had to show "plans" (that is to say diagrams) of the imagined city,
                    and making many clickable elements so that scientific explanations
                    can be displayed about each of them.
                    It was part of the Baccalaureate's rating and thus the TPE.
                    This project was carried out in a single week.

                    Guide of the game <i>Hammerfest</i>, developed by Motion Twin.
                    Complete, clever and ergonomic, it had to gather the maps of
                    all the Caves of Hammerfest,
                    listing all the bonuses and secret passages of the game.
                    It had to accompany the player throughout his career,
                    regardless of their level and the way that it takes,
                    helping him in his ascent of the pyramid scores,
                    symbol of the hierarchy of players Hammerfest.
                    <br />
                    Leaving just my learning of the HTML, it was my very first project
                    on the Web. The project remained in draft form.
